# Data Types and Data Structures in Python

As we know that python is Dynamically typed programming language, than why do we need to learn about data type at all?

Although python automatically understands the data type, but it is important to know about data types so that we can utilize the power of data structures in future.

## Basic Data Types available in python are:

    Numeric - int, float, complex (Immutable)
    Strings (Immutable)
    List (Mutable, mostly used to store homogeneous data types)
    Tuple (Immutable, faster compared to List)
    Set (Unordered collection of items, mutable, removes duplicates)
    Dictionary (Unordered collection of Key-Value Pairs, Mutable, Keys are Unique - values may not be unique)
Strings

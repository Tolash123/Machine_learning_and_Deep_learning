    "# Working with Text Data - Text Preprocessing and Feature Extraction (Text to Numerical Vector)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Analysis is a major application field for machine learning algorithms. Some of the major application areas of NLP are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spell Checker, Keyword Search, etc\n",
    "2. Sentiment Analysis, Spam Classification\n",
    "3. Machine Translation\n",
    "4. Chatbots/Dialog Systems\n",
    "5. Question Answering Systems\n",
    "etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "However the raw data, a sequence of symbols cannot be fed directly to the algorithms themselves as most of them expect numerical feature vectors with a fixed size rather than the raw text documents with variable length.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why NLP is hard?\n",
    "1. Complexity of representation\n",
    " Poems, Sarcasm, etc...\n",
    " Example 1: This task is a piece of cake.\n",
    " Example 2: You have a football game tomorrow. Break a leg!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ambiguity in Natural Language\n",
    " Ambiguity means uncertainity of meaning.\n",
    " For Example: The car hit the pole while it was moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing special characters and punctuations\n",
    "2. Convert sentence into lower case\n",
    "3. Tokenisation\n",
    "4. Removing stop words\n",
    "5. Stemming or Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Extraction Techniques (Convert Text to Numerical Vectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bag of Words\n",
    "2. TF IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)\n",
    "3. Word2Vec (by Google)\n",
    "4. GloVe (Global Vectors by Stanford) - Not Covered in this notebook\n",
    "5. Pretrained GloVe Embeddings\n",
    "6. FastText (by Facebook) - Not Covered in this notebook\n",
    "7. ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) - Not Covered in this notebook\n",
    "8. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer)\n",
    "9. GPT\n",
    "10. LLM's\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Text Preprocessing steps include some essential tasks to clean and remove the noise from the available data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Removing Special Characters and Punctuation - Special characters like ^, ~, @, $, etc... Punctuations like ., ?, ,, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Converting to Lower Case - We convert the whole text corpus to lower case to reduce the size of the vocabulary of our text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tokenization (Sentence Tokenization and Word Tokenization) - This is a simple step to break the text into sentences or words.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Removing Stop Words - Stopwords don't contribute to the meaning of a sentence. So, we can safely remove them without changing the meaning of the sentence. For eg: it, was, any, then, a, is, by, etc are the stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stemming or Lemmatization - Stemming is the process of removing suffixes and reducing a word to some root form. For eg: warm, warmer, warming can be converted to warm."
